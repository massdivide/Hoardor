Who Does wanna just drag and drop some files to a server they own with No stupid dependancies, complex installs, etc.

Here we go. Drag, Drop, Upload. 

Saves the files as a .zip with the original file name. If you are a big dummy and upload the same file again, well it just does a filename_1.zip server side.

The server checks for a key, for the love of god change the master and secret keys.
